    <h1>Welcome to my Website! (Under Construction)</h1>
    <p>This is still very much a work in progress. Currently, I plan on using this (meaning the blank site) as a checklist for what exactly I still need/want to do or add to the site. Right now... there's a lot lol.</p>
    <p>List of completed stuff, in no particular order:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://drwhoprincess.neocities.org/sources-references.html">sources and references</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://drwhoprincess.neocities.org/changelog">site changelog</a></li>
      <li>the rest of the stuff is in the todo.txt file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stuff I have successfully done:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>added a tab icon</li>
      <li>changed the font</li>
      <li>changed the background color</li>
      <li>added a background image</li>
      <li>added a footer!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top of to-do list? Learn more CSS and HTML.</p>
  <footer>
  This is a footer. It will have clickies eventually. Right now, it is blank... Other than this text.
